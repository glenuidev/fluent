// Regex
quantifiers:

{4,} // at least 4, matching as much as it can is called greedyness

{4,5} // 4 up to 5

a* // zero to infinity

a+ // one time to infinity

a? // zero to 1..permutates through because of greedyness

regexp? // p is optional

most meta characters do not need escaping in brackets

// Counting words

function wordCount ( text ) {
	
}

(/<[^>]+./g, '')

(ab|ba) // can be used to store both

^[-+]?[\d.]+$

if you need ^foo$ just compare the two strings

more performant is to strip space from begining then end, instead of doing both at the same time

Dates

\d{4}-(0\d|1[0-2])

avoid greedy quantifirers
dont forget anchors
be as specific as possible
pref non-capturing groups (?:)
minimize backtracking (going too far then working back...performance "destructive backtracking")
