it is about the file where you put everything,
- factoring things into sections

// structure / building large JS apps

module.exports = User;
require('user');

"everyone should be using a common set of modules"

Twitter:
sprockets-commonjs

"assets pipeline"

example: thing.module.js

Note: rails house

ruby / rails developers seem to like coffee script (assuming pre-processing is okay with build scripts?)


key to large scale js apps:
- abstract components
- every component is an open source library
- (written as if it is a stand alone lib)
- instantiated multiple times without adverse affects
- work without being attached to the DOM (easily testible) (no css IDs, only classes)
- store state in controllers (not model or dom)

"children shouldn't know anything about their parents"

webkit console debugger: if you click the puase button twice it will automatically create a breakpoint where an error is caused
$0 - $4 is the last 4 elements you selected
snapshots
- take a heap shot
- manipulate the app
- take another shot
- compare

display:none; // 

accessing the DOM is the slowest thing you can do, if you manipulate it do so when it is not attached to the tree

mousemove handlers need to be fast
