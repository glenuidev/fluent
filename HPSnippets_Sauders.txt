some requests in China are blocked...vendor scripts (from twitter) can prevent page load

IE had a 20 sec timeout on requests
Some can be as long as 120 Seconds

Front end SPOF (single point of failure)

Stylesheets will block all rendering, get them loaded early

Load scripts async (not <script>)
- note..even though it is not used on the page (in the template) it is blocking the experience for all pages that use the template
- templates team should be rigerous about not injecting syncronous scripts at all levels

webpagetest.org

interesting idea: malicious time-outs?


/* 
BLACK HOLE TESTING
*/
blackhole.webpagetest.org 72.66.115.13

setup hosts or proxy to route sub-domains to black-hole

or

setDnsName in webpagetest.org (or local instance) via "script" tab

/*
async loading
*/

some solutions...
have the option to pass id to container (pref)
use doc.write if no container (fall-back)

if document.write() is used at all it will block
maybe use an iframe to make it smaller

/* 
longer cache times but self updating
*/

/*
FRONT END SPOF IS NOT DETECTED BY METRICS (because it happens async after failures)
*/
